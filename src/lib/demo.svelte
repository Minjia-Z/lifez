            What does time mean to you? We are defined by the dates that are
            valuable to us. This is how we perceive time because important
            things happen on these time marks that are like pearls on a string.
            Ever since the day we're born, we look forward to birthdays because
            great memories are attached to these dates, and we hope to make them
            even better for you and the people you care about.
