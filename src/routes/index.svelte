				What does time mean to you? We are defined by the dates that are
				valuable to us. This is how we perceive time because important
				things happen on these time marks that are like pearls on a
				string. Ever since the day we’re born, we look forward to
				birthdays because great memories are attached to these dates,
				and we hope to make them even better for you and the people you
				care about.
			</p>
			<p>
				The LifeZ project will involve a number of small NFT projects,
				all centered around our mission of making lives better. LifeZ
				will also be actively donating to charities that fund brain
				disease research and/or taking care of people in need. We want
				to make our first NFT project - Birthdayz Coinz accessible,
				hence the starting price point of 1 SOL.
			</p>
			<p>
				This will grant ownership to a beautiful, rare, and
				well-detailed 3D coin. Owners will also have the opportunity to
				participate in our process of making changes and improve other
				people’s lives.
